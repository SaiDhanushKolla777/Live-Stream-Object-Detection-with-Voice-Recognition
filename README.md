# Live-Stream-Object-Detection-with-Voice-Recognition
This project integrates a Flask-based web application with real-time object detection and voice recognition capabilities. It uses YOLOv5 for object detection and web technologies for live stream handling and voice recognition.


## Overview
A Flask-based web application that provides real-time object detection using YOLOv5, along with voice recognition capabilities for interactive user experience.

### Features
- **Real-time Object Detection:** Utilizes YOLOv5 for detecting objects in a live video stream.
- **Flask Web Server:** Manages live video streams and serves the web interface.
- **Voice Recognition:** Enhances user interaction through voice commands.
- **Live Stream Display:** Showcases the live stream with detected objects highlighted on the web page.

### Technologies
- Python
- Flask
- YOLOv5 (PyTorch)
- HTML5
- JavaScript

### Usage
Ideal for applications requiring real-time object detection in video streams, supplemented with voice recognition for enhanced interaction.
